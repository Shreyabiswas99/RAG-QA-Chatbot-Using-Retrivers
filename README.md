# Advanced RAG Q&A Chatbot with Chains and Retrievers using Langchain
* Inside this project, I have built a Q&A Chatbot using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) technique.
* When we use retrievers we do not need to store the data in a vectore store or database, we can just return or retrieve them. Chains refer to the sequence of calls - those calls can be calling a LLM model, a tool or a pre processor.
* Together with chains and retrievers, this chatbot is created in langchain where the data for the chatbot comes from a PDF file.

## Setup
* The entire program is run on jupyter notebook. You can also use VScode and open a virtual environment there.
* Downloading certain libraries by creating a requirements.txt file
